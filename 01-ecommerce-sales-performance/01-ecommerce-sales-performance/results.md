# Results: Ecommerce Sales Performance

## Executive summary
Revenue and order volume increase over time, with growth driven primarily by higher order volume rather than changes in average order value. High-value orders contribute a meaningful share of total revenue, and sales are concentrated in a small number of premium apparel products.

## Key findings
- Revenue is highest in January, 2023 and lowest in January, 2019.
- Order volume peaks in January, 2023.
- Average AOV is about $85 and peaks in January, 2019 at $114.58.
- Revenue is concentrated in a small number of high-priced apparel items, particularly Outerwear & Coats and Active categories, with top products generating over $5K–$10K each despite low unit sales
- High-value order segmentation:
  - High value (150+): 14997 orders, avg order value $251.36
  - Mid value (75-149): 20689 orders, avg order value $106.21
  - Low value (<75): 57984 orders, avg order value $36.72

## Business implications
-Prioritize inventory and promotion for premium outerwear and activewear, particularly top revenue drivers such as The North Face Apex Bionic Soft Shell Jacket, The North Face Nuptse 2 Jacket, and Canada Goose Women’s Solaris, which generate high revenue despite low unit sales.
-Design upsell and bundling strategies to move mid-value orders ($75–$149) into the high-value segment, for example by pairing apparel items with complementary accessories (e.g., jackets with socks or shorts) or offering free shipping thresholds above $150.
-Align major marketing campaigns with peak demand periods, particularly January, when both revenue and order volume are highest, to maximize return on ad spend and inventory turnover.
