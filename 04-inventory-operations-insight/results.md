## Results: Inventory and Operations Insights

### Executive summary

Product sales are highly uneven across the catalog. A small number of products generate strong revenue with low unit volume, while most items sell slowly and inconsistently on a weekly basis. Return rates are relatively similar across categories, with only modest variation. Overall, inventory risk is driven more by demand volatility and product price than by category-level differences.

### Key findings

- Weekly product demand is generally low across most items, with many products averaging fewer than two units sold per week.
- Return rates are fairly consistent across categories, mostly ranging between 9% and 11%. Suits, Socks, and Outerwear & Coats show the highest return rates, slightly above the category average.
- Only a small number of products show steady weekly demand, while most products experience irregular sales patterns.
- Demand variability is high for many products, indicating inconsistent week-to-week sales and increased forecasting difficulty.
- The majority of products fall into the slow-mover category, with very few qualifying as medium movers and almost none as fast movers.
- Several high-revenue products generate thousands of dollars in revenue despite selling fewer than ten units, particularly in Outerwear & Coats and Active categories.

### Business implications

- Inventory planning should prioritize high-revenue, low-volume products, as these items contribute disproportionately to revenue while carrying higher stock risk.
- Products with highly volatile weekly demand may require more conservative inventory levels to avoid overstocking.
- Since return rates are similar across categories, inventory decisions should focus more on demand consistency than on category-level return behavior.
- Slow-moving products make up the majority of the catalog, suggesting opportunities to reduce assortment size or test selective promotions to improve turnover.
- High-priced outerwear items warrant closer monitoring due to their revenue impact and low sales frequency.
